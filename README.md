• A requirement to interrogate a database by interacting with an easy to use form.

• A requirement to deal with a number of options on the form, some of which changed depending on selections made in other areas of the form.

• A requirement to deal with an issue concerning ‘select’ boxes where multiple options could be selected.

• A requirement to dynamically update the form as selections are made, rather than when the ‘Submit’ button is pressed.
